I'm Contra, and I want to be a member of the Node Foundation Board of Directors.

Why I would be a good fit:

- Extremely active member in the community since late 2010
- Created 200+ node modules (some of my favorites: gulp, genomejs, rtc-everywhere)
- Built multiple companies using node at scale
- Maintain some of the largest projects in the node ecosystem
- Given talks about open source node at conferences all over the world
- No BS

Thanks
